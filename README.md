GLab is an open source GitLab CLI tool bringing GitLab to your terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code without switching between windows and browser tabs. Work with issues, merge requests, **watch running pipelines directly from your CLI** among other features.
Inspired by [`gh`], the official GitHub CLI tool.

`glab` is available for repositories hosted on GitLab.com and self-managed GitLab Instances. `glab` supports multiple authenticated GitLab instances and automatically detects the authenticated hostname from the remotes available in the working git directory.

## Documentation

Read the [documentation](https://glab.readthedocs.io/) for usage instructions.

## Installation

Download a binary suitable for your OS at the [releases page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases).

### Quick Install

**Supported Platforms**: Linux and macOS

#### Homebrew

```shell
brew install glab

```

or

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profclems/glab/trunk/scripts/install.sh | sudo sh
```

*Installs into `usr/bin`*

**NOTE**: Please take care when running scripts in this fashion. Consider peeking at the install script itself and verify that it works as intended.

### Windows

Available for download via [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli), [scoop](https://scoop.sh), or downloadable EXE installer file.

#### WinGet

```shell
winget install glab.glab
```

Updating (WinGet):

```shell
winget install glab.glab
```

#### Scoop

```shell
brew upgrade glab
```

#### Snapcraft

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/glab)

Make sure you have [snap installed on your Linux distribution](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

1. `sudo snap install --edge glab`
1. `sudo snap connect glab:ssh-keys` to grant ssh access

#### Arch Linux

`glab` is available through the [`community/glab`](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/glab/) package or download and install an archive from the [releases page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases). Arch Linux also supports [snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-on-arch-linux).

```shell
pacman -S glab
```

#### KISS Linux

> WARNING: KISS Linux may no longer be actively maintained, so links to its web domain have been removed from this README.

`glab` is available on the [KISS Linux Community repository](https://github.com/kisslinux/community) as `gitlab-glab`.
If you already have the community repository configured in your `KISS_PATH`, you can install `glab` through your terminal.

```shell
kiss b gitlab-glab && kiss i gitlab-glab
```

#### Alpine Linux

`glab` is available on the [Alpine Community repository](https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/community/glab?h=master) as `glab`.

##### Install

We use `--no-cache`, so running `apk update` before is not required.

```shell
apk add --no-cache glab
```

##### Install a pinned version from edge

To ensure that by default edge is used to get the latest updates. We need the edge repository under `/etc/apk/repositories`.

Afterwards you can install it with `apk add --no-cache glab@edge`

We use `--no-cache` so an `apk update` before is not required.

```shell
echo "@edge http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community" >> /etc/apk/repositories
apk add --no-cache glab@edge
```

##### Alpine Linux Docker-way

Use edge directly

```shell
FROM alpine:3.13
RUN apk add --no-cache glab
```

Fetching latest glab version from edge

```shell
FROM alpine:3.13
RUN echo "@edge http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community" >> /etc/apk/repositories
RUN apk add --no-cache glab@edge
```

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can install from [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=glab&from=0&size=30&sort=relevance&query=glab):

```shell
nix-env -iA nixos.glab
```

### macOS

#### Homebrew

`glab` is available via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/glab)

```shell
brew install glab
```

Updating:

```shell
brew upgrade glab
```

#### MacPorts

`glab`is also available via [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/glab/summary)

```shell
sudo port install glab
```

Updating:

```shell
sudo port selfupdate && sudo port upgrade glab
```

### Building From Source

If a supported binary for your OS is not found at the [releases page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases), you can build from source:

#### Prerequisites for building from source

* `make`
* Go 1.13+

1. Verify that you have Go 1.13+ installed

   ```shell
   $ go version
   go version go1.14
   ```

   If `go` is not installed, follow instructions on [the Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

1. Clone this repository

   ```shell
   git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli.git
   cd glab
   ```

   If you have `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` in your `$PATH`, you can just install with `make install` (install `glab` in `$GOPATH/bin`) and **skip steps 3 and 4**.

1. Build the project

   ```shell
   make
   ```

1. Change PATH to find newly compiled `glab`

   ```shell
   export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
   ```

1. Run `glab version` to confirm that it worked

## Authentication

Get a GitLab access token at <https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens> or <https://gitlab.example.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens> if self-managed. The token must have the `api` scope.

- start interactive setup

  ```shell
  glab auth login
  ```

- authenticate against gitlab.com by reading the token from a file

  ```shell
  glab auth login --stdin < myaccesstoken.txt
  ```

- authenticate against a self-managed GitLab instance by reading from a file

  ```shell
  glab auth login --hostname salsa.debian.org --stdin < myaccesstoken.txt
  ```

- authenticate with token and hostname (Not recommended for shared environments)

  ```shell
  glab auth login --hostname gitlab.example.org --token xxxxx
  ```

## Configuration

By default, `glab` follows the XDG Base Directory [Spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html): global configuration file is saved at `~/.config/glab-cli`. Local configuration file is saved at `.git/glab-cli` in the current working git directory. Advanced workflows may override the location of the global configuration by setting the `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

- To set configuration globally:

  ```shell
  glab config set --global editor vim
  ```

- To set configuration for current directory (must be a Git repository):

  ```shell
  glab config set editor vim
  ```

- To set configuration for a specific host:

  Use the `--host` flag to set configuration for a specific host. This configuration is always stored in the global configuration file with or without the `global` flag.

  ```shell
  glab config set editor vim --host gitlab.example.org
  ```

Available options are (dark|light|notty) or set a custom style
https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour#styles

NO_COLOR: set to any value to avoid printing ANSI escape sequences for color output.

FORCE_HYPERLINKS: set to 1 to force hyperlinks to be output, even when not outputing to a TTY
```

## What about Lab?

Both `glab` and [lab] are open-source tools with the same goal of bringing GitLab to your command line and simplifying the developer workflow. In many ways `lab` is to [hub], while `glab` is to [gh].

If you want a tool that'â€™'s more opinionated and intended to help simplify your GitLab workflows from the command line, then `glab` is for you. However, If you're looking for a tool like [hub] that feels like using Git and allows you to interact with GitLab, you might consider using [lab].

Some `glab` commands such as `ci view` and `ci trace` were adopted from [lab].
