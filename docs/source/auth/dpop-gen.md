# `glab auth dpop-gen`

Generates a DPoP (demonstrating-proof-of-possession) proof JWT

## Synopsis

[Experiment] Demonstrating-proof-of-possession (DPoP, <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec/security-feature-blueprints/-/blob/main/sender_constraining_access_tokens/index.md>) is a technique to
cryptographically bind personal access tokens to their owners. The tools to manage the client aspects of DPoP are
provided by this command.

The command generates a DPoP proof JWT that can be used alongside a Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate
to the GitLab API. It is valid for 5 minutes and will need to be generated again once it expires. Your SSH
private key will be used to sign the JWT. RSA, ed25519, and ECDSA keys are supported.

```plaintext
glab auth dpop-gen [flags]
```

## Examples

```plaintext
# Generate a DPoP JWT for authentication to GitLab
$ glab dpop-gen [flags]
$ glab dpop-gen --private-key "~/.ssh/id_rsa" --pat "glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# No PAT required if the user has previously used the glab auth login command with a PAT
$ glab dpop-gen --private-key "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
# Generate a DPoP JWT for another GitLab instance
$ glab dpop-gen --private-key "~/.ssh/id_rsa" --hostname "https://gitlab.com"

```

## Options

```plaintext
  -h, --hostname string       The hostname of the GitLab instance to authenticate with (default "gitlab.com")
      --pat glab auth login   Personal Access Token (PAT) to generate a DPoP proof for. If this is not provided, the token set with glab auth login will be used. In the absence of both, there will be an error.
  -p, --private-key string    Location of the private SSH key on the local system.
```
