# GitLab CLI - `glab`

GLab is an open source GitLab CLI tool. It brings GitLab to your terminal:
next to where you are already working with Git and your code, without
switching between windows and browser tabs.

- Work with issues.
- Work with merge requests.
- Watch running pipelines directly from your CLI.

![command example](../assets/command-example.png)

The GitLab CLI uses commands structured like `glab <command> <subcommand> [flags]`
to perform many of the actions you normally do from the GitLab user interface:

```shell
# Sign in
glab auth login --stdin < token.txt

# View a list of issues
glab issue list

# Create merge request for issue 123
glab mr for 123

# Check out the branch for merge request 243
glab mr checkout 243

# Watch the pipeline in progress
glab pipeline ci view

# View, approve, and merge the merge request
glab mr view
glab mr approve
glab mr merge
```
